## Hi there!

Hello! My name is George Offley. I am a software engineer and AWS Community Builder! I started working in IT doing network deployments, desktop support work, and admin stuff. I taught myself how to code starting with PHP and JavaScript in 2015. I pivoted to professional software engineering in 2017. While working as a full-time software engineer I went back to school to earn a degree in Computer Science from SNHU. I have always had a passion for technology and building things that have an impact. These days Iâ€™m looking to turn that passion into creating cool projects and finding interesting software-based solutions to challenges. I can usually be found on LinkedIn or Twitter talking about technology.
